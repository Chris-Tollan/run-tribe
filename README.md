## Features
-   ### Design implementation
    - During the initial planning of this project the above wireframes were created however on beginning production and thinking about the target audience of this site, who I assessed to be people looking to stay active and looking to book runs and view content with ease and possibly whilst on the go throughout the day, I decided it would be best to create the site intended for mobile first use. As such minor changes were made to how the features would be displayed such as the hero image would be unique to the homepage and the runs would not be displayed in circular containers around an image. Theses changes from the wireframes to the deployed site can be seen in the images below. I believe it has been the correct decision as the deployed site has a nice easy to use feel to it with a similar display across all devices offering a good overall user experience that I think may have be hindered if the changes had not been made.
      
-   ### NavBar
    -  The NavBar is always located at the top of the page. It is simple and easy to navigate. Logged in users will have full access to the site whereas user who aren't logged in will only have access to limited features. On smaller devices the menu options will collapse into a burger icon.
    -  Collapsed navbar on smaller devices
       ![navbar_collapsed](https://github.com/Chris-Tollan/run-tribe/assets/134441833/f755cbad-07b2-4110-95fa-70335fd13b9f)

## Agile Methodology

- ### Overview
  Agile methodologies and principles were used when planning and creating this project. For the initital planning of this project I identified a number of features and split them into Epics with each epic then containing user stories of what user would look to be able to achieve when using each feature. During the development process I focussed on a specific Epic and then the user stories within that epic which I had recorded as GitHub issues and arranged on a kanBan board. When I felt the acceptance criteria of each user story was met I marked them as complete on the board. This assisted with prioritising and the continuous management of the workload related to this project.

### Known Bugs
-   During development a number of small issues were encountered and overcome
    -    During the implemention of the booking form the when the user would submit the form to book a place on a run the booking would fail due to the booking title not being automatically included in the form. By running the Python Debugger [Python Debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) within the terminal I was able to see that the form was looking for booking.instance.title instead of booking.title that I was originally trying to submit with the form which when corrected as shown below resolved the issue
    
    ![booking_form_bug](https://github.com/Chris-Tollan/run-tribe/assets/134441833/006e0707-95fa-4b57-9692-6e2bee00a38a)

    -    The debugger is used by including 'import pdb; pdb.set_trace()' within the code being tested. This then breaks the code form the line inserted and allowed me to command the debugger from the terminal.

    -    Another issue which arose when updated my models was that tit caused conflicting information in the database. To fix this I followed the following steps to reset the database
        -    Delete all your migration files that start with numbers (don't delete the __init__.py)
        -    Go to the ElephantSQL Database Dashboard and click the reset button to reset the database
        -    Confirm the reset in the confirmation prompt shown
        -    Run the makemigrations and migrate commands in the workspace again as normal and this resolved the issue.

    -    Whilst not neccessary a bug early in the development I accidently push the details of the secret key to github. I obtained guidance re this from the Code Institute slack channel and tutor support. I was informed in order to fix this I had to created a new secret key which should be hidden appropriately to avoid it being pushed to github. I followed these steps and the current secret key has not been pushed to nor is it visable on github.


## Deployment
## Cloning this repository

In order to work on this repository you will first need to clone it.

**Instructions to clone the repository**:

1 - While in the GitHub repository, click on the green code button.

2 - Copy the link.

3 - In your IDE or local coding environment use the link to open the repository. 

For example: in CodeAnywhere
- Click on 'Add new workspace'
- You will then be given the option to 'Create from your project repository' and a box in which to paste the link
- CodeAnywhere will now open a new workspace containing the repository.
- You should now be set up ready to work on the repository.

## Forking a branch

In order to protect the main branch while you work on something new, essential when working as part of a team or when you want to experiment with a new feature, you will need to fork a branch.

**Instructions to fork the repository**:

1 - While in the GitHub repository, click on the branch symbol and text indicating the number of branches.

2 - This will load details on current branches. Click on the green 'New branch' button.

3 - Enter a name for the new branch and then click the green 'create new branch' button.

4 - Your new branch should now have appeared on the screen.

5 - Clicking on the new branch and then following the steps for cloning will allow you to open up and work on this branch.

### ElephantSQL
An external database was created in ElephantSQL using the following steps
1. Log in to ElephantSQL and select 'Create New Instance'
2. Select a plan, input your details and review.
3. Once created, use the copy icon to copy the DATBASE_URL.

### Cloudinary
Cloudinary was used to store static and media files.
1. Log in to Cloudinary
2. Copy your CLOUDINARY_URL

### Before Deployment
Important points for before deployment
1. The requirements for the project were added to a requirements.txt file using the command 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt' in the terminal.
2. In .gitignore, include env.py to ensure sensitive information is not pushed to GitHub. 
3. In settings.py, link SECRET_KEY to the env.py file where the secret key variable is defined.
3. In settings.py, set 'DEBUG = False' to prevent verbose error pages and to prevent Django serving static files itself instead of relying on Cloudinary.
4. It is necessary to make migrations and migrate the models to the database before deployment.

### Deployment to Heroku
This app was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.
1. Log in to Heroku and from the Dashboard, select 'Create New App'
2. Create a unique name for your app, and select your location.
3. Open the settings tab, Click 'Reveal Config Vars', and set the Config Vars for production (values are sensitive and have been left out). 

Config Vars for development of this project:
- DATABASE_URL
- SECRET_KEY
- PORT = 8000
- DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1
- CLOUDINARY_URL

Config Vars for production:
- DATABASE_URL
- SECRET_KEY
- CLOUDINARY_URL

4. Click 'Add buildpack'. The buildpacks will install further dependencies that are not included in the requirements.txt.
5. Select the Deploy tab. You can select to view build log to watch the project being built.
6. When successfully built, a message appears in the build log showing the URL'https://run-tribe-cd76c944e137.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku'. 
7. Click 'Open App' or 'View' to open the deployed app.

## Future Development
-   The future development of this project will include:-
    -    User profile section to further enhance the feeling of the website being an online community for local runners to interact.
    -    The ability for selected users to have 'moderator' permissions allowing them to assist in the maintenance of selected aspects of the site.
    -    The ability to leave comments on runs so that other users can read feedback and user experiences about the different running groups.

## Credits/Acknowleldgements/Code
-   I obtained code directly from the following which was either implemented more or less the same of used and then adapted for the purpose of meeting the needs of this project:-
    -    For the initial set up of this project and then the creation the blog and comments section including the JavaScript used for the Edit/Delete comments features I followed the steps of the Code Institute 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough project. Boilerplate code, NavBar and footer code was then adapted from the walkthrough project to meet the design aspect of this project
    -    When creating the views for Updating and Deleting Bookings I found the following guidance which I used and adapted to meet the need of this project
